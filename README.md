# ComputerCraftPaster
A Pasting utility for the Minecraft Mod Computercraft

This little Program can paste text to the Computer, so you can paste Code directly into the Computer/Turtle. Anyway, this program can be used for any problem, where keyboard typing is neccessary

# Usage 
Paste your text to the Frame and hit the Paste button.  
Now focus to the Minecraft window with an openend Computercraft program (e.g. a Turtle in edit mode).  
The Code should be typed in letter by letter. 

# Beware! At the moment, this program only works with a German keyboard!
